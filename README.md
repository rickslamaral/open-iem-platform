# Open IEM Platform

> Open-source professional personal In-Ear Monitoring platform for Linux.

## What is this?

Open IEM Platform is an open-source, Linux-native system for personal in-ear monitor (IEM) mixing in live audio environments. It allows each musician on stage to control their own independent monitor mix from a smartphone, using a Raspberry Pi or similar Linux SBC as the audio server.

## MVP Scope

- 8 inputs
- 2 stereo mixes
- 2 musicians / 2 clients
- 48 kHz / 32-bit float internal
- Gain, pan, mute, master volume, limiter
- WebSocket control
- PWA mobile interface
- Local LAN only
- Linux (Raspberry Pi 5 target, x86_64 also supported)

## Current Status

**Phase 5 — Audio Transport** (authenticated signaling routes complete; media pipeline SIMULATED on VPS)

WebRTC transport selection is accepted in [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-audio-transport.md). The `server/streaming` crate validates SDP offers, creates one `str0m` peer session per musician, tracks bounded ICE signaling, and defines 48 kHz stereo/20 ms silence-frame contract. `api-server` now exposes authenticated offer and ICE routes plus engineer-only session listing. Real PipeWire capture and Opus frame delivery require Raspberry Pi integration in later phases. VPS has no audio hardware.

See [Phase 5 specification](docs/specifications/PHASE-5-AUDIO-TRANSPORT.md) and [Phase 5 review](docs/reviews/PHASE-5-REVIEW.md).

## Estado Phase 10

Mix assignments persist in SQLite. Engineer/Admin assign mix slots; musicians control only sends belonging to assigned mix. Send state and gain/pan/mute routes are protected by JWT role and ownership checks. Audio remains SIMULATED on VPS until PipeWire/Opus validation on Raspberry Pi 5.
